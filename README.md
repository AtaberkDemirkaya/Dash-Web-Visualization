This code partially implements the work I did during my first internship at Garanti Technology during 2022 summer.
With the data_gen.py file I created an artificial dataset on to an excel file including values for timestamps, alarm type, database name, value, warning threshold and critical threshold.
Using the data.xlsx file that was generated, I read the data and visualize it at my localhost using dropdowns and an interactive graph using Dash framework.
WARNING: Please do remember that this is only a brief implementation of my work as I cannot share the full details. Here's a picture below to give you a better insight of how the graph look when its working.
