This code partially implements the work I did during my first internship at Garanti Technology during 2022 summer.
With the data_gen.py file I created an artificial dataset on to an excel file including values for timestamps, alarm type, database name, value, warning threshold and critical threshold.
Using the data.xlsx file that was generated, I read the data and visualize it at my localhost using dropdowns and an interactive graph using Dash framework.
You can use the dropwons to select different alarm types and databases for checking their status whether they are in the safe zone, warning zone or critical zone.

WARNING: Please do remember that this is only a brief implementation of my work as I cannot share the full details. Here's a picture below to give you a better insight of how the graph look when its working.
